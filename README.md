# ArieraOS
When you are bored and decide making an OS

## NOTE
This Project has been abandoned by me: I won't be fixing any bugs or adding anything.
I do not really recommend you using this code as a template because the code is probably very bad!

## Try it yourself
First install the needed dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install xorriso
sudo -s
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lordmilko/i686-elf-tools/master/i686-elf-tools.sh
chmod +x ./i686-elf-tools.sh
./i686-elf-tools.sh
```
When everything finished run `./comp.sh`. 
If you have qemu installed a window is gonna open with ArieraOS running. 
You now should have a file called `ArieraOS.iso`. 
Feel free to do whatever you want with it.

## TODO
- move to VGA pixel by pixel drawing (with text fonts and print abilities)
